# Mention a user or group

You can mention a team member or [user group](/help/user-groups) to call their attention to a
message. Mentions follow the same
[notification settings](/help/pm-mention-alert-notifications) as private
messages and alert words.

## Mention a user or group

### From the compose box

{start_tabs}

{!start-composing.md!}

2. Type `@` followed by a few letters from a name or email address.

3. Pick the appropriate user or user group from the autocomplete.

{end_tabs}

### From the user list

{start_tabs}

{!right-sidebar-user-card.md!}

1. Select **Copy mention syntax** to add it to your clipboard.

1. Paste the user's mention syntax in the compose box.

{end_tabs}

### Via a message

{start_tabs}

1. Click on a user's profile picture or name on a message they sent
   to open their **user card**.

1. Select **Reply mentioning user** to start a reply to the conversation
   with a mention inserted into the compose box.

{end_tabs}

## Silently mention a user

A silent mention allows you to refer to a user without triggering a
notification. Silent mentions start with `@_` instead of `@`.

{start_tabs}

{!start-composing.md!}

2. Type `@_` followed by a few letters from a name or email address.

3. Pick the appropriate user or user group from the autocomplete.

{end_tabs}

## Mention everyone on a stream

You can mention everyone on a stream with the `@**all**` mention. Use
sparingly! Used improperly, wildcard mentions can be annoying.

Note that this will not notify anyone who has muted the stream, and
users can disable receiving email/push notifications for these
wildcard mentions, either
[globally](/help/pm-mention-alert-notifications) or for [individual
streams](/help/stream-notifications).
