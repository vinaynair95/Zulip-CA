# View your mentions

You can [mention a user or a group](/help/mention-a-user-or-group) to call their
attention to a message. To make such messages easy to find, Zulip lets you view
the messages where you were mentioned from a dedicated tab.

!!! warn ""

    Because [silent mentions](/help/mention-a-user-or-group#silently-mention-a-user)
    are designed not to attract attention, they are excluded from the **Mentions** tab.
